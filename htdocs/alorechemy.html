				<p>Chemistry has justly been called the central science. Chemists study the various substances in the world, with a particular focus on the processes by which one substance is transformed into another. Today, chemistry is defined as the study of the composition and properties of elements and compounds, the structure of their molecules, and the chemical reactions that they undergo. Rather than starting with such modern concepts, though, a fuller appreciation of the subject requires an examination of the historical processes that led to these concepts.</p>

					<p>Philosophy of matter in antiquity
Thales of Miletus
Thales of Miletus
Thales of Miletus, a pre-Socratic philosopher, astronomer, and geometer.
Indeed, the philosophers of antiquity could have had no notion that all matter consists of the combinations of a few dozen elements as they are understood today. The earliest critical thinking on the nature of substances, as far as the historical record indicates, was by certain Greek philosophers beginning about 600 BCE. Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, Empedocles, and others propounded theories that the world consisted of varieties of earth, water, air, fire, or indeterminate “seeds” or “unbounded” matter. Leucippus and Democritus propounded a materialistic theory of invisibly tiny irreducible atoms from which the world was made. In the 4th century BCE, Plato (influenced by Pythagoreanism) taught that the world of the senses was but the shadow of a mathematical world of “forms” beyond human perception.

In contrast, Plato’s student Aristotle took the world of the senses seriously. Adopting Empedocles’s view that the terrestrial region consisted of earth, water, air, and fire, Aristotle taught that each of these materials was a combination of qualities such as hot, cold, moist, and dry. For Aristotle, these “elements” were not building blocks of matter as they are thought of now; rather, they resulted from the qualities imposed on otherwise featureless prime matter. Consequently, there were many different kinds of earth, for instance, and nothing precluded one element from being transformed into another by appropriate adjustment of its qualities. Thus, Aristotle rejected the speculations of the ancient atomists and their irreducible fundamental particles. His views were highly regarded in late antiquity and remained influential throughout the Middle Ages.

For thousands of years before Aristotle, metalsmiths, assayers, ceramists, and dyers had worked to perfect their crafts using empirically derived knowledge of chemical processes. By Hellenistic and Roman times, their skills were well advanced, and sophisticated ceramics, glasses, dyes, drugs, steels, bronze, brass, alloys of gold and silver, foodstuffs, and many other chemical products were traded. Hellenistic Alexandria in Egypt was a centre for these arts, and it was apparently there that a group of ideas emerged that later became known as alchemy.

Alchemy
Three different sets of ideas and skills fed into the origin of alchemy. First was the empirical sophistication of jewelers, gold- and silversmiths, and other artisans who had learned how to fashion precious and semiprecious materials. Among their skills were smelting, assaying, alloying, gilding, amalgamating, distilling, sublimating, painting, and lacquering. The second component was the early Greek theory of matter, especially Aristotelian philosophy, which suggested the possibility of unlimited transformability of one kind of matter into another. The third of alchemy’s roots consisted of a complex combination of ideas derived from Asian philosophies and religions, Hellenistic mystery religions, and what became known as the Hermetic writings (a body of pseudonymous Greek writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy ascribed to the Egyptian god Thoth or his Greek counterpart Hermes Trismegistos). It is important to note, however, that Hellenistic Egypt is only one of several candidates for the homeland of alchemy; at about the same time, similar ideas were developing in Persia, China, and elsewhere.

In general, alchemists sought to manipulate the properties of matter in order to prepare more valuable substances. Their most familiar quest was to find the philosopher’s stone, a magical substance that would transmute ordinary metals such as copper, tin, iron, or lead into silver or gold. Important materials in this craft included sulfur, mercury, and electrum (a gold-silver alloy). However, many other alchemists spurned alchemical transmutation (aurifaction), devoting their efforts instead to a pharmaceutical preparation known as the “elixir of life” that would cure any disease, including the ultimate disease, death. The philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life could be considered parallel quests, for each would “cure” metallic or human bodies, respectively, yielding immortal perfection. There was a parallel religious dimension to all this as well. Finally, some alchemists spurned material manipulations entirely, devoting themselves to meditation with the goal of achieving spiritual purity and ultimate redemption.

After the rise of Islam, Arabic-speaking scholars of the 9th century translated Greek scientific and philosophical works into their own language. Thereafter, philosophers in the Islamic world pursued chemical and alchemical ideas with enthusiasm and success. The sizable number of modern chemical words derived from Arabic—alcohol, alkali, alchemy, zircon, elixir, natron, and others—suggests the importance of this period for the history of chemistry. One of the leading ideas of medieval Arabic alchemy was the theory that all metals were formed of sulfur and mercury in various proportions and that altering those proportions could transform the metal under study—even to produce silver or gold from lead or iron. Not every alchemist, however, believed in the possibility of such transmutations.

Later, scholars in Christian western Europe learned of ancient Greek and early medieval Arabic philosophy by translating these books into Latin. Thus, the alchemical tradition, along with the rest of the Greco-Arabic philosophical and scientific corpus, passed to the West in the course of the 12th century. Well-known Scholastic philosophers of the 13th century, such as Roger Bacon in England and Albertus Magnus in Germany and France, wrote on alchemy. Alongside this learned literature, the empirical chemical arts continued to flourish and comprised a largely separate realm of expertise among artisans, engineers, and mechanics.

An important Western alchemist of the late 13th century was the pseudonymous Latin writer who called himself Geber in homage to the 8th-century Arab alchemist Jābir ibn Ḥayyān. Geber was the first to record methods for the preparation and use of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid; the earliest clear evidence for widespread familiarity with distilled alcohol also does not much predate his day. These substances could only have been produced by novel stills that were more robust and efficient than their predecessors, and the appearance of these remarkable new materials produced dramatic changes in the repertoire of chemists.

The Renaissance saw even stronger interest in the science. The German-Swiss physician Paracelsus practiced alchemy, Kabbala, astrology, and magic, and in the first half of the 16th century he championed the role of mineral rather than herbal remedies. His emphasis on chemicals in pharmacy and medicine was influential on later figures, and lively controversies over the Paracelsian approach raged around the turn of the 17th century. Gradually the Hermetic influence declined in Europe, however, as certain celebrated feats of putative aurifaction were revealed as frauds.

It would be a mistake to think that open-minded empirical investigation that is well integrated with theory (which is how one might define science) was absent from the history of alchemy. Alchemy had many quite scientific practitioners through the centuries, notably including Britain’s Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton—heroes of the scientific revolution of the 17th century—who applied systematic and quantitative method to their (mostly secret) alchemical studies. Indeed, as late as the end of the 17th century there was little to distinguish alchemy from chemistry, either substantively or semantically, since both words were applied to the same set of ideas. It was only in the early 18th century that chemists conferred different definitions on the two words, banishing alchemy to the ashbin of discredited occult pseudosciences.

Phlogiston theory
This shift was partly simple self-promotion by chemists in the new environment of the Enlightenment, whose vanguard glorified rationalism, experiment, and progress while demonizing the mystical. However, it was also becoming ever clearer that certain central ideas of alchemy (especially metallic transmutation) had never been demonstrated. One of the leaders in this regard was the German physician and chemist Georg Ernst Stahl, who vigorously attacked alchemy (after dabbling in it himself) and proposed an expansive new chemical theory. Stahl noted parallels between the burning of combustible materials and the calcination of metals—the conversion of a metal into its calx, or oxide. He suggested that both processes consisted of the loss of a material fluid, contained within all combustibles, called phlogiston.

Phlogiston became the centrepiece of a broad-ranging theory that dominated 18th-century chemical thought. Phlogiston, in short, was thought to be a material substance that defined combustibility. When metallic iron becomes red rust, it loses its phlogiston, just as a burning log does. The ashes of the log and the red rust “ashes” (calx) of iron can no longer burn because they no longer contain the principle of combustibility, or phlogiston. But iron calx can be converted back to the metal if it is strongly heated in the presence of a phlogiston-rich substance such as charcoal. The charcoal donates its phlogiston (becoming ashes itself), while the calx turns into molten metallic iron. Thus, smelting (reduction) of metallic ores could also be understood in phlogistic terms. Later phlogistonists added respiration to the number of phenomena that the theory could elucidate. An animal breathes air, emitting phlogiston in an analogy to a slow fire, fueled by the phlogiston-rich food it consumes. Earth’s atmosphere avoids excess accumulation of phlogiston because plants incorporate it into combustible plant tissues that can then be used as animal food. Combustion, calcination, or respiration eventually cease in an enclosed space because air has a limited capacity to absorb the phlogiston emitted from the burning, calcining, or respiring entity.

The phlogiston theory became popular both because of its great success in explaining phenomena and guiding further investigation and because of a certain Enlightenment predilection for materialistic physical theories (the putative fluid of heat became known as caloric, and there were other suggested fluids of electricity, light, and so on). This materialist-mechanist trend can also be seen in the diffuse but powerful influence of Newton and René Descartes on chemists of the 18th century. Enlightenment chemists established distinctive scientific communities and a well-defined discipline (closely allied, to be sure, with medical and artisanal studies) in the major countries of Europe. The chemist’s workplace or laboratory (the word itself had been coined in the Renaissance to apply to the chemical arts) was now closely associated with the field, and a standardized repertoire of operations was taught there.

Still unsettled were some fundamental issues relating to chemical composition. To a phlogistonist, a metallic calx was elemental, and the associated metal was a compound of calx plus phlogiston. This puzzled some, though, since the metal gained rather than lost weight when it supposedly lost phlogiston to become a calx. The issues were sharpened in the 1770s, when the virtuoso English chemist (and Unitarian minister) Joseph Priestley produced a new gas by heating certain minerals. A candle burned in this gas with extraordinary vigour, and in an enclosed space a mouse breathing it survived far longer than one could in ordinary air. Priestley’s explanation was that the new gas had been radically dephlogisticated and, hence, had much greater capacity than air for absorbing phlogiston.

Actually, gases (then usually known as airs) were a relatively novel object of chemical attention. In Scotland in 1756, Joseph Black studied the gas given off in respiration and combustion, characterizing it chemically and following its participation in certain chemical reactions. (Black, a physician, taught chemistry as a branch of medicine, as did most academic chemists of this era.) He called the new gas “fixed air,” since it was also found “fixed” in certain minerals such as limestone. His discovery that this gas was a normal component of common air (at a fraction of a percent, to be sure) was the first clear indication that atmospheric air was a mixture rather than a homogeneous element. In the following quarter century, many new gases were discovered and studied, by such workers as Priestley, the English physicist and chemist Henry Cavendish, and the Swedish pharmacist Carl Scheele.

The chemical revolution
The new research on “airs” attracted the attention of the young French aristocrat Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. Lavoisier commanded both the wealth and the scientific brilliance to enable him to construct elaborate apparatuses to carry out his numerous ingenious experiments. In the course of just a few years in the 1770s, Lavoisier developed a radical new system of chemistry, based on Black’s methods and Priestley’s dephlogisticated air.

Lavoisier first determined that certain metals and nonmetals absorb a gaseous substance from the air in undergoing calcination or combustion and, in the process, increase in weight. Initially, he thought that this gas must be Black’s fixed air, for he knew of no other chemical species present in ordinary air; moreover, fixed air was known to be produced in smelting, so it seemed reasonable to think that it was present in the calx that was smelted. At this point (October 1774), Priestley communicated to Lavoisier his discovery of dephlogisticated air. Further experiments led Lavoisier to continuously modify his ideas, until it finally became clear to him that it was this new gas, and not fixed air, that was the active entity in combustion, calcination, and respiration. Moreover, he determined (or so he thought, at least) that this gas was contained in all acids. He renamed it oxygen, Greek for “acid producer.”

Lavoisier’s oxygen was in some respects the inverse of phlogiston. Rather than releasing anything, the combustible or metal absorbed (more precisely, chemically combined with) oxygen in the process that Lavoisier now called oxidation. He showed that atmospheric air was a mixture of two principal components, oxygen and a physiologically inert gas (known to Priestley) that he called azote or nitrogen. He also showed that water is a chemical compound of two substances, oxygen and what Cavendish had called “inflammable air.” The latter gas was now renamed hydrogen (“water producer”). Black’s fixed air proved to be a gaseous form of oxidized carbon, or carbon dioxide. The various parts of Lavoisier’s new system were beginning to fit together beautifully.

The keys to Lavoisier’s success were twofold. First, he carefully accounted for all the substances, including gases, entering into and emerging from the chemical reactions he studied by tracking their weights with the greatest possible precision. He knew to do this partly from Black’s example, but he proceeded with a mastery that the science had never before seen. Second, he established a simple operational definition of a chemical element—namely, a substance that could not be reduced in weight as the result of any chemical reaction that it undergoes. Oxygen, carbon, iron, and sulfur were now regarded as elements, along with close to 30 other substances. Lavoisier wrote a textbook to promote the new oxygenist chemistry, Traité élémentaire de chimie (1789), which appeared in the same year the French Revolution began. He and his associates also developed a new nomenclature—essentially the one used today for inorganic compounds—along with a new journal. As an aristocrat of the ancien régime and an investor in a tax-collection agency, Lavoisier was executed in the Reign of Terror, but by that time (1794) the chemical revolution that he had started had largely succeeded in replacing phlogistonist chemistry.

Atomic and molecular theory
Lavoisier’s set of chemical elements, and the new way of understanding chemical composition, proved to be invaluable for analytic and inorganic chemistry, but in a real sense the chemical revolution had only just begun. Around the turn of the century, the English Quaker schoolteacher John Dalton began to wonder about the invisibly small ultimate particles of which each of these elemental substances might be composed. He thought that if the atoms of each of the elements were distinct, they must be characterized by a distinct weight that is unique to each element. Although these atoms were far too small to weigh individually, he realized that he could deduce their weights relative to each other—the ratio of the weight of an atom of oxygen to one of hydrogen, for instance—by examining reacting weights of macroscopic quantities of these elements. In fact, the laws of stoichiometry (combining weights of elements) were just then being developed, and Dalton used these regularities to justify his inferences. His first discussion of these issues dates to 1803, and he presented his atomic theory in the multivolume New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808–27).

Dalton’s atomic theory was a landmark event in the history of chemistry, but it had a crucial flaw. His procedure required that one know the formulas of the simple compounds resulting from the combination of the elements. For example, analytical data of that day indicated that water resulted from the combination of seven parts by weight of oxygen with one part of hydrogen. If the resulting water molecule was HO (one atom of each element combining to form a molecule of water), then the weight ratio of the atoms of these elements must be the same, seven to one. However, if the formula were H2O, then the weight of an oxygen atom would have to be 14 times the weight of a hydrogen atom. There was simply no way to determine molecular formulas at that time, so Dalton made assumptions based on the simplicity of nature. He chose HO as his water formula and, therefore, seven as the relative atomic weight of oxygen.

In the following years, several leading chemists adopted essential elements of Dalton’s theory, but many objected to the hypothetical elements just described; some also doubted the very possibility of investigating the world of the invisibly small. In 1808 the French chemist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac discovered that when gases combine chemically, they do so in small integral multiples by volume. Three years later the Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro argued that this fact suggested that equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of constituent particles (Avogadro’s law), physical conditions being the same. This idea provided a physical method of determining certain molecular formulas. For instance, Gay-Lussac had pointed out that exactly two volumes of hydrogen combine with precisely one of oxygen to form water. If Avogadro was right, the formula for water had to be H2O. But this line of reasoning also led to the uncomfortable notion that elementary gases had polyatomic molecules (O2, H2, and so on), and therefore many chemists rejected Avogadro’s hypotheses.

By far the greatest of the early atomists was the Swede Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who accepted parts of Avogadro’s ideas and developed an elaborate version of chemical atomism by 1826. It was Berzelius who in 1813 had proposed the alphabetic system for denoting elements, atoms, and molecular formulas, and the use of formulas as an aid for studying chemical composition and reactions began to blossom about 1830. However, different chemists were still making different assumptions regarding the formulas of simple compounds such as water, and so, for decades, various inconsistent systems of atomic weights and formulas were in use in the various European countries.

Berzelius also developed a theory of chemical combination based on the electrochemical studies that the invention of the battery (1800) had spawned. He became convinced that all molecules were held together by the Coulomb force, the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged objects. (Berzelius assumed that a molecule’s constituent atoms or groups of atoms were not neutral, and he called these charged components radicals.) This theory of electrochemical dualism worked well with inorganic compounds, but organic substances seemed anomalous. Particularly in the 1830s, when chemists learned how to replace the hydrogen of organic compounds with chlorine atoms, Berzelius’s theory appeared to be threatened—after all, hydrogen and chlorine had opposite electrochemical characteristics, yet the substitution seemed to make little difference in the properties of the compounds. In the 1840s and ’50s, extensive debates over rival systems of chemical atomism and over electrochemical dualism enlivened the journal literature.

Organic radicals and the theory of chemical structure
Both problems were finally resolved through the further development of organic chemistry. The leading organic chemists of the day were the German Justus von Liebig and the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste-André Dumas. In 1830 Liebig invented a device that made organic analysis rapid, convenient, and accurate, and his laboratory institute at the tiny University of Giessen in Hesse became the most famous chemical school in the world. Liebig taught an enormous number of chemists, and his students assisted in his research program. He was the leading figure in the rise of the research university and in the idea of a research group. As a professor at Giessen, and later at the University of Munich, he laid much emphasis on practical applications of chemistry, especially for physiology, agriculture, and consumer products. Dumas exerted a similar influence in France, training students and pursuing research at a private laboratory in Paris.

Both Liebig and Dumas initially accepted the Berzelian scheme and sought to understand organic molecules as composed of identifiable radicals held together electrochemically. The younger French chemists Auguste Laurent and Charles Gerhardt pursued chlorine substitution reactions and cast doubt on this simple model; sometime after 1840 Liebig and Dumas both retreated into positivism. In 1852 Liebig’s English former postdoctoral assistant Edward Frankland noticed a regularity in the combining capacity of the atoms of certain metals and semimetals. At about the same time, two former students of both Liebig and Dumas, Alexander Williamson in London and Charles-Adolphe Wurtz in Paris, were independently approaching the same idea from a different direction. Using a system of atomic weights and formulas developed by Gerhardt and Laurent—a modified version of Berzelius’s system that incorporated Avogadro’s ideas more consistently—they proposed that oxygen atoms could combine with two other simple atoms, such as hydrogen, or with two organic radicals and that nitrogen atoms could combine with three. This was the beginning of the concept of atomic valence.

In 1858 the young German theorist August Kekule then expanded this concept to carbon, not only proposing that carbon atoms were tetravalent but adding the idea that they could bond to each other to form chains, comprising a molecular “skeleton” to which other atoms could cling. Kekule’s theory of chemical structure clarified the compositions of hundreds of organic compounds and served as a guide to the synthesis of thousands more. (The self-chaining of carbon atoms was independently developed by the Scottish chemist Archibald Scott Couper.) This theory experienced dramatic expansion when Kekule successfully applied it to aromatic compounds (after 1865) and after Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff of the Netherlands and Joseph LeBel of France independently began to investigate molecular structures in three dimensions—later called stereochemistry.

Mendeleev’s periodic law
Dmitri Mendeleev
Dmitri Mendeleev
Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the 63 known elements into a periodic table based on atomic mass, which he published in Principles of Chemistry (1869).
Kekule’s innovations were closely connected with a reform movement that gathered steam in the 1850s, seeking to replace the multiplicity of atomic weight systems with Gerhardt’s and Laurent’s proposal. Indeed, Kekule could not have succeeded with structure theory if he had not started with the reformed atomic weights. Kekule, Wurtz, and German chemist Carl Weltzien were organizers of the first international chemical conference, held at Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany in September 1860, which was intended to gain unity and understanding across the European chemical community. The Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro played perhaps the most critical role at the conference. The reformers’ success was incomplete, but the Karlsruhe Congress can stand as an appropriate symbol of the era when chemistry attained a recognizably modern appearance.

The widespread adoption of a single reformed set of atomic weights for the 60-odd known elements appears to have prompted renewed speculation on the relationships of the elements to each other, and various proposals for systems of classification were developed in the 1860s. By far the most successful of these systems was that of the Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleev. In 1869 he announced that when the elements were arranged horizontally according to increasing atomic weight, and a new horizontal row was begun below the first whenever similar properties in the elements reappear, then the resulting semi-rectangular table revealed consistent periodicities. The vertical columns of similar elements were called groups or families, and the entire array was called the periodic table of the elements. Mendeleev demonstrated that this manner of looking at the elements was more than mere chance when he was able to use his periodic law to predict the existence of three new elements, later named gallium, scandium, and germanium, which were discovered in the 1870s and ’80s.

periodic table
periodic table
Modern version of the periodic table of the elements.
To be sure, there were still many anomalies. For example, 15 chemically similar rare earth elements had been discovered by the end of the century. These elements were resistant to any periodic system; eventually they were grouped together in a separate category, the lanthanides (later called the lanthanoids; see transition element). Then in the 1890s British scientists William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh discovered the inert, or rare, gases argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. These were all clearly members of a single chemical family, but there were no vacant spaces in the table for them. Soon after the turn of the 20th century, chemists decided simply to create an extra group for them.

Structuralist ideas from organic chemistry, as well as the development of the periodic table, gave new impetus to the study of inorganic compounds in the late 19th century. The leading chemical field in the second half of the century, however, was clearly organic chemistry, and the leading country was Germany. It was the Germans who exploited the structure theory most aggressively, and their success was measured by the explosive growth of university institutes as well as by practical applications developed in commercial enterprises. Organic chemists such as August Wilhelm von Hofmann and Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin and Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich developed large research groups that turned out novel compounds, research publications, and doctoral dissertations by the score. By the late 19th century, German chemistry, both academic and industrial, dominated Europe and the world.

The rise of physical chemistry
This is not to say that other approaches to chemistry were neglected, nor that other countries failed to participate in the excitement. Physical studies of chemical compounds and reactions began early in the century, and the field of physical chemistry had achieved maturity by the 1880s. Michael Faraday in England, Hermann Kopp and Robert Bunsen in Germany, and Henri-Victor Regnault in France carried out investigations on the physical characteristics of substances in the period 1830–60. Studies of heat, work, and force led to the rise of thermodynamics around 1850; originally oriented almost entirely to the science of physics, figures such as the American Josiah Willard Gibbs, the Frenchmen Marcellin Berthelot and Pierre Duhem, and the Germans Hermann von Helmholtz and Wilhelm Ostwald then applied energy and entropy concepts to chemistry in the 1870s and ’80s. Electrochemistry, invented by the independent efforts of Berzelius and Humphry Davy in England at the beginning of the century, was pursued fruitfully by Faraday and others. Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff of Germany developed chemical spectroscopy in the late 1850s. Studies on the kinetics of chemical reactions began in the 1860s.

All this work culminated in the “official” establishment of the field of physical chemistry, traditionally considered to be when the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie (“Journal of Physical Chemistry”) began publication in 1887. The editors were Ostwald and van ’t Hoff, with Svante Arrhenius of Sweden, a future Nobelist, an especially important member of its editorial board. Controversies over the reality of ionic dissociation and other issues connected with electrochemistry, the theory of solutions, and thermodynamics enlivened early issues of the journal.

Physical chemists were in increasing demand as universities turned to them for instruction in basic courses on general and theoretical chemistry. This was nowhere more true than in the United States, with its vigorously expanding educational structure, including both private and state (land-grant) universities and emerging German-influenced doctoral programs. Soon after the turn of the century, two chemists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who had studied with Ostwald, Arthur Noyes and Gilbert Lewis, formed the nucleus of a rising American chemical community. Noyes continued his career at Throop Polytechnic in Pasadena (later renamed the California Institute of Technology, commonly known as Caltech), and Lewis went on to the University of California at Berkeley.

Rutherford atomic model
Rutherford atomic model
Physicist Ernest Rutherford envisioned the atom as a miniature solar system, with electrons orbiting around a massive nucleus, and as mostly empty space, with the nucleus occupying only a very small part of the atom. The neutron had not yet been discovered when Rutherford proposed his model, which had a nucleus consisting only of protons.
Bohr model of the atom
Bohr model of the atom
In the Bohr model of the atom, electrons travel in defined circular orbits around the nucleus. The orbits are labeled by an integer, the quantum number n. Electrons can jump from one orbit to another by emitting or absorbing energy. The inset shows an electron jumping from orbit n=3 to orbit n=2, emitting a photon of red light with an energy of 1.89 eV.
Physical chemistry was profoundly altered by what some have called the second scientific revolution—namely, the discoveries of the electron, X-rays, radioactivity, and new radioactive elements, the understanding of radioactive emissions and nuclear decay processes, and early versions of the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity. All of this happened in just 10 years, from 1895 to 1905, and the scientific bombshells continued in the following years. In 1911 the British physicist Ernest Rutherford proposed a nuclear model of the atom, but his orbiting electrons seemed to violate classical electromagnetic theory, and the model was not immediately embraced. However, two years later the Danish physicist Niels Bohr resolved some of these anomalies by applying spectroscopic data and the quantum theory of the German physicists Max Planck and Albert Einstein to Rutherford’s model (see figure). Bohr went on to head an international theoretical research group in Copenhagen that led in developing quantum mechanics during the 1920s. In the meantime, Rutherford revealed the existence of the proton and Einstein advanced his theory of general relativity.

Electronic theories of valence
So much for the physicists; but the chemists were not sitting on their hands through all of this. Since its discovery a half century earlier, one of the greatest puzzles in chemistry had been the central phenomenon of valence. It was as inexplicable as it was incontrovertibly true that oxygen atoms had exactly two valence “hooks” with which to form bonds and carbon normally had four (that is to say, oxygen is divalent, carbon tetravalent). Moreover, these bonds were not radially symmetrical like electrostatic charges or gravitation but seemed to be directed at distinct spatial angles around the atom. And the existence of highly stable elementary molecules such as H2 was downright embarrassing—for what could be the basis for the strong attraction of two identical atoms for each other? Some scientists, such as the great Swiss chemist Alfred Werner, used combinations of structural-organic and ionic theories to develop a scheme that brilliantly explained the structures of complex inorganic substances known as coordination compounds.

polar covalent bond
polar covalent bond
In polar covalent bonds, such as that between hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the electrons are not transferred from one atom to the other as they are in an ionic bond. Instead, some outer electrons merely spend more time in the vicinity of the other atom. The effect of this orbital distortion is to induce regional net charges that hold the atoms together, such as in water molecules.
Others would take their cue from the discovery of the electron. As early as 1902, taking into account the work of the English physicist J.J. Thomson, Werner, and Ramsay and Rayleigh on the rare gases, Lewis privately drew casual sketches—depicting cubic atoms with outer electrons—that constituted the first step toward an electronic theory of chemical bonding. However, it was not until after Rutherford and Bohr had provided the early development of the nuclear theory of the atom that Lewis’s ideas gelled. (Simultaneously and independently, the German physicist Walther Kossel published a similar theory.) Lewis suggested that a chemical bond consisted of a pair of electrons that was shared between the combining atoms. By equal sharing of electrons (forming what the American physical chemist Irving Langmuir was soon to call a covalent bond), each atom could complete its outer electron shell and thus achieve stability. The normally complete outer shell, Lewis thought, contained eight electrons—the configuration of the notably stable (that is, inert) rare gases. This was the octet rule, and it helped to explain why Mendeleev’s periodicities often came in multiples of eight.

The Lewis-Kossel-Langmuir electronic theory of valence (1916–23) was very incomplete, but was also extraordinarily fruitful for further developments, and essential elements of it survived for decades. In 1922 Bohr proposed electron configurations in the so-called K, L, M, and N shells. The theory was soon thereafter modified by breaking developments in quantum mechanics achieved by Bohr, German physicist Werner Heisenberg, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, and others. In 1927 two German researchers working with Schrödinger in Zürich, Fritz London and Walter Heitler, produced the first-ever quantum mechanical treatment of a chemical system, the hydrogen molecule.

The American physical chemist Linus Pauling (along with another American, John Slater) independently developed this approach into what he called the valence bond method of understanding chemical combination. The orbitals in the various electron shells (classified by the letters s, p, d, and f) could be mathematically “hybridized,” resulting in the directed bonds actually observed in chemical compounds. Pauling also made extensive use of the quantum mechanical resonance effect, especially for understanding aromatic compounds. All of this was summarized in his classic work The Nature of the Chemical Bond (1939). An alternative quantum mechanical method of understanding chemical bonding, called the molecular orbital method, was developed by the American chemist Robert Mulliken and the German physicist Friedrich Hund. Although mathematically more complex, this approach has largely replaced Pauling’s. In any case, ever since Lewis and Bohr, it has been understood that all chemical reactions and all chemical bonding involves the outer electron shells—the valence electrons—of participating atoms.

Organic chemists also incorporated electronic ideas into their theories. In the 1920s the Englishmen Robert Robinson and Christopher Ingold—bitter rivals then and later—led in the development of electronic theories of organic reaction mechanisms by focusing on rearranging electron pairs over the course of chemical reactions. Not only did this allow chemists to understand the intimate details of reactions in a way that had not previously been possible, but it also allowed them to successfully predict the reactivities of organic compounds in different chemical environments. Other studies of quantum mechanics applied to organic substances, combined with the kinetics of reactions, the nature of acids and bases, and instrumental methods of understanding compounds, led to a well-developed specialty field of physical organic chemistry.

Biochemistry, polymers, and technology
Organic chemistry, of course, looks not only in the direction of physics and physical chemistry but also, and even more essentially, in the direction of biology. Biochemistry began with studies of substances derived from plants and animals. By about 1800 many such substances were known, and chemistry had begun to assist physiology in understanding biological function. The nature of the principal chemical categories of foods—proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates—began to be studied in the first half of the century. By the end of the century, the role of enzymes as organic catalysts was clarified, and amino acids were perceived as constituents of proteins. The brilliant German chemist Emil Fischer determined the nature and structure of many carbohydrates and proteins. The announcement of the discovery (1912) of vitamins, independently by the Polish-born American biochemist Casimir Funk and the British biochemist Frederick Hopkins, precipitated a revolution in both biochemistry and human nutrition. Gradually, the details of intermediary metabolism—the way the body uses nutrient substances for energy, growth, and tissue repair—were unraveled. Perhaps the most representative example of this kind of work was the German-born British biochemist Hans Krebs’s establishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or Krebs cycle, in the 1930s.

But the most dramatic discovery in the history of 20th-century biochemistry was surely the structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), revealed by American geneticist James Watson and British biophysicist Francis Crick in 1953—the famous double helix. The new understanding of the molecule that incorporates the genetic code provided an essential link between chemistry and biology, a bridge over which much traffic continues to flow. The individual “letters” that make the code—four nucleotides named adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine—were discovered a century ago, but only at the close of the 20th century could the sequence of these letters in the genes that make up DNA be determined en masse. In June 2000, representatives from the publicly funded U.S. Human Genome Project and from Celera Genomics, a private company in Rockville, Md., simultaneously announced the independent and nearly complete sequencing of the more than three billion nucleotides in the human genome. However, both groups emphasized that this monumental accomplishment was, in a broader perspective, only the end of a race to the starting line.

DNA is, of course, a macromolecule, and an understanding of this centrally important category of chemical compounds was a precondition for the events just described. Starch, cellulose, proteins, and rubber are other examples of natural macromolecules, or very large polymers. The word polymer (meaning “multiple parts”) was coined by Berzelius about 1830, but in the 19th century it was only applied to special cases such as ethylene (C2H4) versus butylene (C4H8). Only in the 1920s did the German chemist Hermann Staudinger definitely assert that complex carbohydrates and rubber had huge molecules. He coined the word macromolecule, viewing polymers as consisting of similar units joined head to tail by the hundreds and connected by ordinary chemical bonds.

Empirical work on polymers had long predated Staudinger’s contributions, though. Nitrocellulose was used in the production of smokeless gunpowder, and mixtures of nitrocellulose with other organic compounds led to the first commercial polymers: collodion, xylonite, and celluloid. The last of these was the earliest plastic. The first totally synthetic plastic was patented by Leo Baekeland in 1909 and named Bakelite. Many new plastics were introduced in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, including polymerized versions of acrylic acid (a variety of carboxylic acid), vinyl chloride, styrene, ethylene, and many others. Wallace Carothers’s nylon excited extraordinary attention during the World War II years. Great effort was also devoted to develop artificial substitutes for rubber—a natural resource in especially short supply during wartime. Already by World War I, German chemists had substitute materials, though many were less than satisfactory. The first highly successful rubber substitutes were produced in the early 1930s and were of great importance in World War II.

During the interwar period, the leading role for chemistry shifted away from Germany. This was largely the result of the 1914–18 war, which alerted the Allied countries to the extent to which they had become dependent on the German chemical industries. Dyes, drugs, fertilizers, explosives, photochemicals, food chemicals (such as chemicals for food additives, food colouring, and food preservation), heavy chemicals, and strategic materiel of many kinds had been supplied internationally before the war largely by German chemical companies, and, when supplies of these vital materials were cut off in 1914, the Allies had to scramble to replace them. One particularly striking example is the introduction of chlorine gas and other poisons, starting in 1915, as chemical warfare agents. In any case, after the war ended, chemistry was enthusiastically promoted in Britain, France, and the United States, and the interwar years saw the United States rise to the status of a world power in science, including chemistry.

All this makes clear why World War I is sometimes referred to as “the chemists’ war,” in the same way that World War II can be called “the physicists’ war” because of radar and nuclear weapons. But chemistry was an essential partner to physics in the development of nuclear science and technology. Indeed, the synthesis of transuranium elements (atomic numbers greater than 92) was a direct consequence of the research leading to (and during) the Manhattan Project in World War II. This is all part of the legacy of the dean of nuclear chemists, American Glenn Seaborg, discoverer or codiscoverer of 10 of the transuranium elements. In 1997, element 106 was named seaborgium in his honour.

The instrumental revolution
As far as the daily practice of chemical research is concerned, probably the most dramatic change during the 20th century was the revolution in methods of analysis. In 1930 chemists still used “wet-chemical,” or test-tube, methods that had changed little in the previous hundred years: reagent tests, titrations, determination of boiling and melting points, elemental combustion analysis, synthetic and analytic structural arguments, and so on. Starting with commercial labs that provided an out-source for routine analyses and with pH meters that displaced chemical indicators, chemists increasingly began to rely on physical instrumentation and specialists rather than personally administered wet-chemical methods. Physical instrumentation provides the sharp “eyes” that can see to the atomic-molecular level.

In the 1910s J.J. Thomson and his assistant Francis Aston had developed the mass spectrograph to measure atomic and molecular weights with high accuracy. It was gradually improved, so that by the 1940s the mass spectrograph had been transformed into the mass spectrometer—no longer a machine for atomic weight research but rather an analytical instrument for the routine identification of complex unknown compounds (see mass spectrometry). Similarly, colorimetry had a long history, dating back well into the previous century. In the 1940s colorimetric principles were applied to sophisticated instrumentation to create a range of usable spectrophotometers, including visible, infrared, ultraviolet, and Raman spectroscopy. The later addition of laser and computer technology to analytical spectrometers provided further sophistication and also offered important tools for studies of the kinetics and mechanisms of reactions.

Chromatography, used for generations to separate mixtures and identify the presence of a target substance, was ever more impressively automated, and gas chromatography (GC) in particular experienced vigorous development. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which uses radio waves interacting with a magnetic field to reveal the chemical environments of hydrogen atoms in a compound, was also developed after World War II. Early NMR machines were available in the 1950s; by the 1960s they were workhorses of organic chemical analysis. Also by this time, GC-NMR combinations were introduced, providing chemists unexcelled ability to separate and analyze minute amounts of sample. In the 1980s NMR became well known to the general public, when the technique was applied to medicine—though the name of the application was altered to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to avoid the loaded word nuclear.

Many other instrumental methods have seen vigorous development, such as electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction. In sum, between 1930 and 1970 the analytical revolution in chemistry utterly transformed the practice of the science and enormously accelerated its progress. Nor did the pace of innovation in analytical chemistry diminish during the final third of the century.

Organic chemistry in the 20th century
No specialty was more affected by these changes than organic chemistry. The case of the American chemist Robert B. Woodward may be taken as illustrative. Woodward was the finest master of classical organic chemistry, but he was also a leader in aggressively exploiting new instrumentation, especially infrared, ultraviolet, and NMR spectrometry. His stock in trade was “total synthesis,” the creation of a (usually natural) organic substance in the laboratory, beginning with the simplest possible starting materials. Among the compounds that he and his collaborators synthesized were alkaloids such as quinine and strychnine, antibiotics such as tetracycline, and the extremely complex molecule chlorophyll. Woodward’s highest accomplishment in this field actually came six years after his receipt of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1965: the synthesis of vitamin B12, a notable landmark in complexity. Progress continued apace after Woodward’s death. By 1994 a group at Harvard University had succeeded in synthesizing an extraordinarily challenging natural product, called palytoxin, that had more than 60 stereocentres.

These total syntheses have had both practical and scientific spin-offs. Before the “instrumental revolution,” syntheses were often or even usually done to prove molecular structures. Today they are a central element of the search for new drugs. They can also illuminate theory. Together with a young Polish-born American chemical theoretician named Roald Hoffmann, Woodward followed up hints from the B12 synthesis that resulted in the formulation of orbital symmetry rules. These rules seemed to apply to all thermal or photochemical organic reactions that occur in a single step. The simplicity and accuracy of the predictions generated by the new rules, including highly specific stereochemical details of the product of the reaction, provided an invaluable tool for synthetic organic chemists.

Stereochemistry, born toward the end of the 19th century, received steadily increasing attention throughout the 20th century. The three-dimensional details of molecular structure proved to be not only critical to chemical (and biochemical) function but also extraordinarily difficult to analyze and synthesize. Several Nobel Prizes in the second half of the century—those awarded to Derek Barton of Britain, John Cornforth of Australia, Vladimir Prelog of the Soviet Union, and others—were given partially or entirely to honour stereochemical advances. Also important in this regard was the American Elias J. Corey, awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1990, who developed what he called retrosynthetic analysis, assisted increasingly by special interactive computer software. This approach transformed synthetic organic chemistry. Another important innovation was combinatorial chemistry, in which scores of compounds are simultaneously prepared—all permutations on a basic type—and then screened for physiological activity.

Chemistry in the 21st century
Two more innovations of the late 20th century deserve at least brief mention, especially as they are special focuses of the chemical industry in the 21st century. The phenomenon of superconductivity (the ability to conduct electricity with no resistance) was discovered in 1911 at temperatures very close to absolute zero (0 K, −273.15 °C, or −459.67 °F). In 1986 two Swiss chemists discovered that lanthanum copper oxide doped with barium became superconducting at the “high” temperature of 35 K (−238 °C, or −397 °F). Since then, new superconducting materials have been discovered that operate well above the temperature of liquid nitrogen—77 K (−196 °C, or −321 °F). In addition to its purely scientific interest, much research focuses on practical applications of superconductivity.

In 1985 Richard Smalley and Robert Curl at Rice University in Houston, Tex., collaborating with Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex in Brighton, Eng., discovered a fundamental new form of carbon, possessing molecules consisting solely of 60 carbon atoms. They named it buckminsterfullerene (later nicknamed “buckyball”), after Buckminster Fuller, the inventor of the geodesic dome. Research on fullerenes has accelerated since 1990, when a method was announced for producing buckyballs in large quantities and practical applications appeared likely. In 1991 Science magazine named buckminsterfullerene their “molecule of the year.”

Two centuries ago, Lavoisier’s chemical revolution could still be questioned by the English émigré Joseph Priestley. A century ago, the physical reality of the atom was still doubted by some. Today, chemists can maneuver atoms one by one with a scanning tunneling microscope, and other techniques of what has become known as nanotechnology are in rapid development. The history of chemistry is an extraordinary story.</p>
